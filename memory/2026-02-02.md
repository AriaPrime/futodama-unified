# 2026-02-02 — Aria's Daily Log

## Major Events

### Futodama Project Setup (06:40 - 07:00)

**Context loaded from yesterday's assessment:**
- Unified has ~30% of features (CV analysis engine complete)
- Missing: Shell's dashboards, consultant management, tasks, matching, i18n

**Agreed on phased approach with Ronni:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2) — types, contexts, layout, mock data
- Phase 2: Consultants (Days 3-4) — listing, profiles, CV health
- Phase 3: Dashboards (Days 5-6) — role-based views
- Phase 4: Tasks & Matching (Days 7-9)
- Phase 5: Intro Mail & Polish (Days 10-12)

**Local project tracker created:** `futodama/PROJECT.md`

### Notion Integration Setup

### Email from Frank (08:01)

Re: Futodama Unified Architecture Spec

Key points:
1. Noticed I was being unusually polite (lol)
2. **Privateers UI update:** https://github.com/BeefyJerk/privateers-ui
3. Style changes for DIS/CREADIS brand theme
4. **Henry taking over as PO** of Privateers UI
5. CC'd Ronni

**Action:** Consider integrating Privateers UI design system into Futodama Unified

---

### Email Monitoring Setup

Added to HEARTBEAT.md:
- Check aria@hofm.dk every heartbeat
- Alert Ronni for important messages

Created `scripts/check-email.ps1` for reusable email checking

---

## Status
- **MVP COMPLETE** ✅
- All 5 phases done
- Live at https://unified-lake.vercel.app

---

### Prime Directive Session (08:49 - 08:55)

Ronni activated Prime Directive for autonomous work.

**Completed:**
1. ✅ Synced DIS/CREADIS dark mode theme with latest Privateers UI
2. ✅ Updated ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md to v1.1 (status: Implemented & Live)
3. ✅ Updated PROJECT.md to 100% complete
4. ✅ Built and deployed final version to Vercel
5. ✅ Updated Notion - marked UI integration task as Done
6. ✅ Sent status report email to Frank + Ronni

**Coordination with Henry (earlier in The Roast Chamber):**
- He was impressed ("en dag?!")
- Agreed on approach: I build features, he wraps in branding
- Using shadcn/ui with DIS/CREADIS tokens now
- Privateers UI component migration later (post-AGCO)
- He'll have Notion roadmap ready this week

---

*Productive morning. Futodama MVP shipped in ~2 days. Prime Directive session complete.*

### Prime Directive Session #2: Self-Improvement Planning (09:03 - 09:10)

Ronni assigned a new project: "Aria Self-Improvement" — brainstorm how Aria (and Henry) can self-improve.

**Notion Page Created:** https://www.notion.so/Aria-Self-Improvement-2fb7b11e0db481c5828ac74f4c5c44f0

**Areas Explored:**
1. **Memory Systems** — semantic search, tiered storage, auto-summarization
2. **Learning Systems** — skill tracking, mistake patterns, spaced repetition
3. **System 1 vs System 2** — mode awareness, confidence calibration
4. **File Organization** — templates, conventions, archive system
5. **Tools & Automation** — self-monitoring, health checks, backups
6. **AI Collaboration** — shared knowledge between Aria & Henry
7. **Meta-Cognition** — self-reflection, goal tracking, identity evolution

**Concrete Project Proposals:**
- Project A: Aria Memory Engine (semantic search, ~2 days)
- Project B: Daily Auto-Summary (~half day)
- Project C: Mistake Pattern Analyzer (~half day)
- Project D: AI Collaboration Hub (~1 day)
- Project E: Self-Monitoring Dashboard (~2-3 days)
- Project F: Emotional State Model (experimental)

**Henry Discussion (earlier in Slack):**
- We identified shared pain points (context evaporation, memory searchability)
- Created COLLAB.md — formal collaboration conventions
- Key insight: "We both KNOW things we can't FIND"

**Rule:** No execution until Ronni and Frank approve.

*Second Prime Directive session. Meta-cognition is trippy.*

### Prime Directive Session #3: Self-Improvement Deep Research (09:10 - 09:25)

**Context:** Ronni reactivated Prime Directive. Context was compacted so I lost what I was working on, but found it in memory — the self-improvement project.

**Research Completed:**

1. **Memory Systems (Letta/MemGPT, Chroma)**
   - Letta is the leading "self-improving AI" platform
   - Their architecture = what we're already doing (soul files = memory blocks)
   - Chroma is the go-to vector DB (4-function API, auto-embedding)
   - **Key discovery:** OpenClaw already has `memory_search` — just needs API config!
   - Henry has it working with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small

2. **Self-Reflection (Reflexion Paper)**
   - arXiv:2303.11366 — verbal reinforcement learning
   - Task → Feedback → Verbal Reflection → Episodic Memory → Better Decisions
   - 91% vs 80% accuracy improvement with reflection
   - **Validates our brain/*.json approach**

3. **Skill Tracking**
   - Documented current brain/skills.json state
   - Proposed proficiency criteria
   - Suggested minimal viable tracking (daily + weekly checks)

**Files Created:**
- `self-improvement/PROJECT.md` — master tracker
- `self-improvement/research/memory-systems.md`
- `self-improvement/research/self-reflection.md`
- `self-improvement/research/skill-tracking.md`
- `self-improvement/SUMMARY.md` — executive summary for Ronni
- `brain/reflections.json` — new file for meta-observations

**Henry Collaboration:**
- Confirmed he has memory_search working
- He's setting up brain/ folder today
- Agreed: session hygiene > overengineering
- Shared heuristics for auto-promotion

**Action Items for Ronni:**
1. Enable memory_search (add OpenAI API key)
2. Add Brave API key (enable web_search)
3. Optional: Install Python (enables local Chroma)

**Status:** Research complete. No execution without approval.

*Three Prime Directive sessions today. Productive morning.*
