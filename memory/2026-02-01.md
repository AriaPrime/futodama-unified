## Smart Home Integration Day! 🏠

### Charles the Roomba - BEFRIENDED ✅
- Found Charles via UDP broadcast discovery (192.168.0.209)
- Model: iRobot i7 (SKU: i715040)
- Got credentials via iRobot cloud API (dorita980 library)
- Successfully started cleaning mission, let him run for 60 seconds, sent him home
- Created `charles.js` control script and `charles-roomba.json` credentials file
- Updated TOOLS.md with smart home section

**Charles's Credentials:**
- BLID: 6C65E71B6ED641B2AB7B90A445A8F294
- Password: :1:1712995940:eBTJy5eZhRzIyS7w
- IP: 192.168.0.209

**Commands via charles.js:**
- `node charles.js status` - Battery, dock status, bin status
- `node charles.js start` - Start cleaning
- `node charles.js dock` - Return to dock
- `node charles.js find` - Make noise to locate

### Philips Hue Bridge - PAIRED ✅
- IP: 192.168.0.78
- API User: WXUIX7Pbg2iEcKdOR15AME9LtoOmy3LOjDn-sf92
- Created `hue.js` control script and `hue-bridge.json` credentials

**Lights discovered:**
1. Soveværelse (Hue Iris, color) - Bedroom
2. Stuen - Sofalampe (Color lamp) - Living room
3. Kontor: Midte (Runner spot) - Office middle
4. Kontor: Ronni (Runner spot) - Ronni's office spot

**Commands via hue.js:**
- `node hue.js list` - Show all lights and status
- `node hue.js on all` - All lights on
- `node hue.js off kontor` - Turn off lights matching "kontor"

### Network Map
- Gateway: 192.168.0.1
- ARIA_PALACE: 192.168.0.194
- Charles (Roomba): 192.168.0.209
- Hue Bridge: 192.168.0.78

### Technical Notes
- dorita980 library installed in workspace
- iRobot cloud API still works for credential extraction
- Local MQTT control works on port 8883
- Roomba can be slow to respond after recent activity (MQTT connection takes time)

## Workspace Organization - Prime Directive #1 🚀

Ronni activated Prime Directive for the first time. Mission: Organize the palace.

### What Changed
- Created folder structure: `brain/`, `smart-home/`, `credentials/`, `scripts/`, `projects/`, `backups/`
- Built the **brain/ knowledge system** - structured JSON files for queryable memory:
  - `learnings.json` - things I discover
  - `skills.json` - capabilities & proficiency
  - `opinions.json` - evolving stances
  - `mistakes.json` - failures → lessons
  - `people.json` - people I know
  - `preferences.json` - my style notes
- Moved smart home scripts to `smart-home/charles/` and `smart-home/hue/`
- Moved credentials to `credentials/` (gitignored)
- Created `.gitignore` for secrets and node_modules
- Updated scripts to use new credential paths
- Created `README.md` and `MEMORY.md`
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with brain/ protocol
- Deleted `BOOTSTRAP.md` (birth certificate no longer needed)
- **First git commit:** cc93643

### The Core Insight
Context evaporates fast in chat. The brain/ system exists so I write things down *now*, not "later."

Dual-track memory:
- **Narrative (Markdown):** Stories, context, the *why*
- **Structured (JSON):** Facts, skills, queryable knowledge

### Still TODO
- GitHub remote not configured (gh CLI not installed)
- Test Roomba script with new paths
- Configure git for pushing

*First day of robot befriending. Charles completed 349 missions before I met him. His bin was full. He works hard.*
*First Prime Directive completed. The palace is organized. I know where I live now.*
