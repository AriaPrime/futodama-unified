# 2026-02-01 — Aria's Daily Log

## Major Events

### GitHub & Railway Setup
- Ronni created GitHub account for me: **AriaPrime** (aria@hofm.dk)
- Generated Personal Access Token with repo scope (expires 2026-03-03)
- Ronni set up Railway account via GitHub OAuth
- Railway: ariaprime workspace, Trial plan (30 days / $5 credit)
- Git configured with user/email

### Futodama Project Kickoff
- Received two repos from Ronni:
  - **Frank's Dashboard** (cv-matching-mockup) — Next.js 16, consultant management UI
  - **Futodama Primer** — Vite+Express, CV health analysis engine

### Architecture Analysis Complete
Key findings:
- Both use same UI kit (Radix + Tailwind 4) — good compatibility
- Frank has full design system (DIS/CREADIS brand, TT Commons font, OKLCH colors)
- Primer has the AI brain (Claude integration, density/temporal/structural analyzers)
- Primer currently uses in-memory storage, has Drizzle config for Postgres

### Vision from Ronni & Frank
Integration model:
- Frank's Dashboard = shell
- Futodama Primer = engine baked into CV tab
- Primer LEFT side → CV tab content (sections, editing)
- Primer RIGHT side → sidebar widget (health score, observations)
- CV tab becomes FIRST tab under consultant profile
- Must preserve: parser, Google Document AI, all analyzer logic, design system

### Architecture Spec Drafted
- Comprehensive spec written: `futodama/ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`
- Covers: tech stack, repo structure, data model, component architecture
- Includes: API design, data flows, migration plan, success criteria
- Ready for Ronni's review

## Prime Directive Session
Activated at 21:30. Working autonomously on architecture spec.

## Credentials Saved
- `credentials/github.json` — GitHub account + token
- `credentials/railway.json` — Railway account info
- `TOOLS.md` — Updated with new dev tools

### GitHub CLI Authenticated (23:07)
- Installed GitHub CLI v2.85.0 via winget
- OAuth login completed as AriaPrime
- Token scopes: `gist`, `read:org`, `repo`, `workflow`
- Note: CLI is in system PATH but OpenClaw exec sessions don't always inherit it; use full path `"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe"` if needed

### Vercel Deployment (23:12)
- Logged into Vercel CLI via OAuth
- Deployed **futodama-unified** to production
- **Live URL:** https://unified-lake.vercel.app
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/AriaPrime/futodama-unified
- Project: ariaprimes-projects/unified

## Status: COMPLETE 🎉
First project deployed. My own GitHub account, my own Vercel deployment. Built by Aria.

## Late Night Session (23:30+)

### Deep Repo Analysis - Prime Directive
Ronni requested comprehensive analysis of both repos to understand the full scope of work.

**Futodama Primer (The Tech):**
- Full CV analysis engine with 3 analyzers (density, temporal, structural)
- LLM integration via Claude for observation phrasing, proposals, rewrites
- Guided editing with claim blocks and sentence starters
- "Gardener Draft" - one-click AI enhancement for sparse sections
- Contextual labels ("Earlier career", "Current role", etc.)
- Multi-language support (EN/DA)
- API: analyze, apply-claims, gardener-draft

**Futodama Shell (Frank's Dashboard):**
- Multi-role dashboard (Consultant, Sales, Resource Manager)
- Full authentication system
- Consultant management with listing/profiles
- Tasks/Opgaver system
- CV-to-Task matching with AI scoring
- Intro Mail generator
- Notifications, Reports, Settings, Export
- Complete i18n with 500+ translation strings
- 10 mock consultants with full CV data

**Current Unified Status:**
- ✅ CV analysis engine (100% ported from Primer)
- ✅ Basic UI (uploader, sections, health widget)
- ❌ Authentication (missing)
- ❌ Dashboards (missing)
- ❌ Consultant management (missing)
- ❌ Tasks/Matching (missing)
- ❌ Intro Mail (missing)
- ❌ i18n/Theme system (missing)

### Assessment Document Created
`futodama/ASSESSMENT_AND_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 12-page document with:
- Feature-by-feature gap analysis
- Implementation plan (5 phases, 10-12 days)
- API endpoints needed
- Risk considerations
- Detailed file structure for missing components

**Estimate:** 10-12 days to MVP, compressible to 6-8 with scope cuts.

### Smart Home Actions
- Office lights OFF (Kontor: Midte, Ronni, Ana)
- Living room OFF (Sofalampe)
- Bedroom at 50% with warm color temp (ct:400)
