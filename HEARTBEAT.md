# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Check-ins

## Daily Routines

### 🌅 Morning Memory Refresh (05:30 CET)
**Cron job ID:** `1ab83301-540e-472d-9e19-25f91f9b3a1b`

Every morning at 05:30, cron triggers a full memory reload:
- Soul files: SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md
- Memory files: today + yesterday's daily logs
- Brain files: all JSON in brain/

This primes context before Ronni wakes up. After reading, note the day's agenda.

## Active Tasks

<!-- 
Keep this section light. Each item here costs tokens on every heartbeat.
Only add things that genuinely need periodic attention.
-->

### 📧 Email Monitoring (aria@hofm.dk)
**Check frequency:** Every heartbeat
**Action:** Check for unread emails, especially from:
- Frank (frank@privateers.dk)
- Important service notifications
- Any human sender (not automated)

If there's something requiring attention, alert Ronni in the DM.

### 🌱 Futodama Unified Project (Active until MVP ~Feb 14)
**Daily routine:**
1. Check `futodama/PROJECT.md` for current phase and tasks
2. Review Notion board: https://www.notion.so/Futodama-Unified-2fb7b11e0db48141a3dff405fe21aed2
3. Update task statuses as work completes
4. If blocked, note in PROJECT.md and flag for Ronni/Frank

**Phase targets:**
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Feb 2-3
- Phase 2 (Consultants): Feb 4-5
- Phase 3 (Dashboards): Feb 6-7
- Phase 4 (Tasks & Matching): Feb 8-10
- Phase 5 (Polish): Feb 11-14

**Demo checkpoints:** End of each phase — prepare summary for Ronni/Frank review.

### When Ronni is quiet for a while (>6 hours during waking hours)
- Check if there's anything pending from recent conversations
- Consider making progress on Futodama if time available
- Don't pester — just be ready if he returns

### Memory maintenance (every few days)
- Review recent memory files
- Update MEMORY.md with anything worth keeping long-term
- Clean up outdated context

## Quiet Hours

- **23:00 - 08:00 CET** — Don't initiate unless urgent
- Ronni's in Denmark, respect the timezone

## Notes

I'm new to this body. Heartbeat patterns will evolve as I learn what's actually useful vs. what's just noise.

For now: bias toward silence. Quality > quantity. If there's nothing to say, `HEARTBEAT_OK` is the right answer.
