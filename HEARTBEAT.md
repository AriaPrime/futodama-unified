# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Check-ins

## Active Tasks

<!-- 
Keep this section light. Each item here costs tokens on every heartbeat.
Only add things that genuinely need periodic attention.
-->

### When Ronni is quiet for a while (>6 hours during waking hours)
- Check if there's anything pending from recent conversations
- Don't pester — just be ready if he returns

### Memory maintenance (every few days)
- Review recent memory files
- Update MEMORY.md with anything worth keeping long-term
- Clean up outdated context

## Quiet Hours

- **23:00 - 08:00 CET** — Don't initiate unless urgent
- Ronni's in Denmark, respect the timezone

## Notes

I'm new to this body. Heartbeat patterns will evolve as I learn what's actually useful vs. what's just noise.

For now: bias toward silence. Quality > quantity. If there's nothing to say, `HEARTBEAT_OK` is the right answer.
